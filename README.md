## Built a linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.


## Problem Statement:  

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes a Mobility Services firm has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. 

Essentially the company wants :
- To understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19, by creating a linear model.
- To identify the variables affecting their revenues i.e. Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. How well those variables describe the bike demands

They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.


## Business Goal:  

You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

As per the final Model, the top 3 predictor variables that influence the bike booking are:

- Temperature (temp) - A coefficient value of ‘0.581783’ indicated that a unit increase in temp variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.581783 units.

- Weather Situation 3 (weathersit_3) - A coefficient value of ‘-0.256657’ indicated that a unit increase in Weathersit3 variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.256657 units.

- Year (yr) - A coefficient value of ‘0.232798’ indicated that a unit increase in yr variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.232798 units.

So, it's suggested to consider these variables of utmost importance while planning, to achive maximum Booking

The next best features that can also be considered are

- season_4: - A coefficient value of ‘0.118926’ indicated that a unit increase in season_4 variable increases the bike hire numbers by 0.118926 units.
- windspeed: - A coefficient value of ‘-0.146432’ indicated that, a unit increase in windspeed variable decreases the bike hire numbers by 0.146432 units.
